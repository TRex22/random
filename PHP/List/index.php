	Welcome to the Game Dev list. The list was originally a <a href="http://www.ambrosine.com/resource.html">very outdated static page</a> that was hidden obscurely somewhere on the vast net, and eventually the need was 
	seen for an <a href="http://www.nag.co.za/forums/showthread.php?3452-Info-Resource-downloads-thread">update to the list</a> to make it more relevant and try to keep it current. Unfortunately this was a rather difficult task to keep done in a thread on a forum. 
	And that brought upon this third evolution of the list.<br><br>
	A big thanks to Keeyai for hosting this new list, also, why dont you head over to <a href="muagames.com">muagames.com</a> and give them some support while you're at it!
